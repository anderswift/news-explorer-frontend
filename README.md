[View website online](https://newsexplorer.anderswift.com)

### Project Description:
This project includes a front end in React, with a responsive layout displaying search results from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/). Users can create an account, search for news articles by keyword, and save articles to their own account to return to later. The back end allowing users to save articles is a custom API built with Node.js, using Express and MongoDB (Find the repository for the back end API [here](https://github.com/anderswift/news-explorer-api)). 

This project incorporates:

* BEM Methodology
* Flexbox
* CSS Grids
* CSS transitions
* Mobile-First Responsive Design
* Embedded custom fonts
* Asynchronous API calls using callbacks and Promises
* Multiple routes and navigation using React Router
* Front end authentication system for user registration and login
* Locally-stored tokens to 'remember' logged in users and previous search data
